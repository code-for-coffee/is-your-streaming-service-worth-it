# Is your streaming service worth it?

Find out if your streaming service is worth it or not (Last.fm account required).

## Usage

* Fork & clone this repository.
* In `app.js`, replace the `usr` variable on line 3 with your Last.fm username.
* Run `app.js`

#### Notes

This class uses `fetch()` to async and recursively update each instantiated object's `this.props`. `toString()` and `toObject()` should be regarded with that in mind.
